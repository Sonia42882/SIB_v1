**Dataset used in this project :**
" Novozymes Enzyme Stability Prediction ", a dataset to help identify the thermostable mutations in enzymes. Available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/novozymes-enzyme-stability-prediction .

>Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts in the chemical reactions of living organisms. The goal of this competition is to predict the thermostability of enzyme variants. The experimentally measured thermostability (melting temperature) data includes natural sequences, as well as engineered sequences with single or multiple mutations upon the natural sequences.
>Understanding and accurately predict protein stability is a fundamental problem in biotechnology. Its applications include enzyme engineering for addressing the world’s challenges in sustainability, carbon neutrality and more. Improvements to enzyme stability could lower costs and increase the speed scientists can iterate on concepts.
